# MindMate

Decided to build a mobile group chat application, called MindMate, in order to help people deal with crucial life issues. 
We have already seen the way texts have replaced normal conversation and helped people stay connected from distant parts of the world. 
We wanted to take advantage of this connectivity to help people find others who are dealing with the same or similar issues.
These issues can be mental such as depression, Schizophrenia, anorexia or physical ailments such as cancer. 
It basically brings groups such as Alcoholics Anonymous online. When you cannot afford a therapist, or you don't have time due to a busy schedule or are restricted
by geographical limitations, MindMate provides quick and free access to emotional support from people who are going through something similar.
Being college students, there is no one better who can understand the impact of such comfort from your peers and we want everyone to be able to experience that.
